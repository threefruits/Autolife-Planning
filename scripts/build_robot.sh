# Note: we intentionally do NOT pass --repair-meshes. CoACD runs downstream
# and outputs each collision piece as a convex hull, which is already manifold
# and safe for foam. Repairing (often convex-hulling) the full mesh upstream
# would corrupt the geometry CoACD needs to decompose.
#
# We also do not pass --distribute-to: the third_party submodules are kept as
# unmodified header-only dependencies; all project-local spherization artefacts
# stay under resources/robot/autolife.
