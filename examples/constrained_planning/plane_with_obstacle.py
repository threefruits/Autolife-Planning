"""Plane constraint + sphere obstacle: arm bends around, gripper stays flat.

Same plane manifold as ``plane.py`` (left gripper z pinned to its
home value), but with a solid red sphere planted squarely in the
gripper's swept arc.  The planner has to curve the arm around the
obstacle while the gripper keeps sliding across the plane — the
classic curobo-style demo: end-effector constraint + collision
avoidance, handled by a single ``ProjectedStateSpace`` planner.

The plane shows up as a translucent blue plate, the obstacle as a
translucent red sphere, and the sphere is also discretised into a
volumetric point cloud so VAMP's SIMD collision checker sees it.
