"""Line constraint: the left gripper rides a horizontal rail.

Two holonomic equations in a single stacked residual — the
gripper's y and z coordinates are pinned to their home values, so
the only free Cartesian DOF at the end effector is x.  The arm has
7 joints and the constraint consumes 2 equations, so there's a
5-dimensional null space the planner can exploit.

A bold green cylinder marks the rail.
