"""Plane constraint: the left gripper slides across a horizontal surface.

A single holonomic equation written as a CasADi expression — the
left gripper's world z-coordinate must equal its home value.  OMPL's
``ProjectedStateSpace`` projects every sampled state onto the plane
before validation, so the gripper trajectory is guaranteed flat
from start to goal.

A translucent blue plate is drawn at the target height to show the
manifold in 3D.
